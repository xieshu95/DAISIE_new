\usage{
DAISIE_sim_constant_rate(time, M, pars, replicates, divdepmodel = "CS",
  nonoceanic_pars = c(0, 0), num_guilds = NULL, prop_type2_pool = NA,
  replicates_apply_type2 = TRUE, sample_freq = 25, plot_sims = TRUE,
  hyper_pars = NULL, area_pars = NULL, dist_pars = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{Numeric defining the length of the simulation in time units.
For examples, if an island is known to be 4 million years old, setting
time = 4 will simulate the entire life span of the island; setting time = 2
will stop the simulation at the mid-life of the island.}

\item{M}{Numeric defining the size of mainland pool, i.e. the number of
species that can potentially colonize the island.}

\item{pars}{A numeric vector containing the model parameters:
\itemize{
  \item{pars[1]: lambda^c (cladogenesis rate)}
  \item{pars[2]: mu (extinction rate)}
  \item{pars[3]: K (carrying capacity), set K=Inf for diversity
  independence.}
  \item{pars[4]: gamma (immigration rate)}
  \item{pars[5]: lambda^a (anagenesis rate)}
  \item{pars[6]: lambda^c (cladogenesis rate) for either type 2 species
  or rate set 2 in rate shift model}
  \item{pars[7]: mu (extinction rate) for either type 2 species or rate
  set 2 in rate shift model}
  \item{pars[8]: K (carrying capacity) for either type 2 species or rate
  set 2 in rate shift model, set K=Inf for diversity independence.}
  \item{pars[9]: gamma (immigration rate) for either type 2 species or
  rate set 2 in rate shift model}
  \item{pars[10]: lambda^a (anagenesis rate) for either type 2 species
  or rate set 2 in rate shift model}
}
The elements 6:10 are required only when type 2 species are included
or in the rate shift model.}

\item{replicates}{Number of island replicates to be simulated.}

\item{divdepmodel}{Option divdepmodel = 'CS' runs a model with clade-specific
carrying capacity, where diversity-dependence operates only within single
clades, i.e. only among species originating from the same mainland colonist.
Option divdepmodel = 'IW' runs a model with island-wide carrying capacity,
where diversity-dependence operates within and among clades. Option
divdepmodel = 'GW' runs a model with diversity-dependence operates within
a guild.}

\item{nonoceanic_pars}{A vector of length two with:
\itemize{
  \item{[1]: the probability of sampling a species from the mainland}
  \item{[2]: the probability of the species sampled from the mainland
  being nonendemic}
  }}

\item{num_guilds}{The number of guilds on the mainland. The number of
mainland species is divided by the number of guilds when \code{divdepmodel =
"GW"}}

\item{prop_type2_pool}{Fraction of mainland species that belongs to the
second subset of species (type 2). Applies only when two types of species
are simulated (length(pars) = 10). For \code{\link{DAISIE_dataprep}} applies
only if number_clade_types = 2.  In \code{\link{DAISIE_dataprep}} the
default "proportional" sets the fraction to be proportional to the number
of clades of distinct macroevolutionary process that have colonised the
island.}

\item{replicates_apply_type2}{Applies only when two types of species are
being simulated. Default replicates_apply_type2 = TRUE runs simulations
until the number of islands where a type 2 species has colonised is equal to
the specified number of replicates. This is recommended if prop_type2_pool
is small or if the rate of immigration of type two species (pars[9]) is low,
meaning that more replicates are needed to achieved an adequate sample size
of islands with type 2 species. Setting replicates_apply_type2 = FALSE
simulates islands up to the specified number of replicates regardless of
whether type 2 species have colonised or not.}

\item{sample_freq}{Numeric specifing the number of units times should be
divided by for plotting purposes. Larger values will lead to plots with
higher resolution, but will also run slower.}

\item{plot_sims}{Default = TRUE plots species-through-time (STT) plots. It
detects how many types of species are present. If only one type of species
is present, STT is plotted for all species. If two types are present, three
plots are produced: STT for all, STT for type 1 and STT for type 2.}

\item{hyper_pars}{A named list of numeric hyperparameters for the rate
calculations as returned by \code{\link{create_hyper_pars}}:
\itemize{
\item{[1]: is d_0 the scaling parameter for exponent for calculating
cladogenesis rate}
\item{[2]: is x the exponent for calculating extinction rate}
\item{[3]: is alpha, the exponent for calculating the immigration rate}
\item{[4]: is beta the exponent for calculating the anagenesis rate.}
}}

\item{area_pars}{A named list containing area and sea level parameters as
created by \code{\link{create_area_pars}}:
\itemize{
  \item{[1]: maximum area}
  \item{[2]: value from 0 to 1 indicating where in the island's history the
  peak area is achieved}
  \item{[3]: sharpness of peak}
  \item{[4]: total island age}
  \item{[5]: amplitude of area fluctuation from sea level}
  \item{[6]: frequency of sine wave of area change from sea level}
  \item{[7]: angle of the slope of the island}
}}

\item{dist_pars}{A named list of a numeric distance from the mainland as
created by \code{\link{create_dist_pars}}:
\itemize{
\item{[1]: is D distance from the mainland}
}}

\item{verbose}{In simulation and dataprep functions a logical,
\code{Default = TRUE} gives intermediate output should be printed.
For ML functions a numeric determining if intermediate output should be
printed, \code{Default = 0} does not print, \code{verbose = 1} prints
intermediate output of the parameters and loglikelihood, \code{verbose = 2}
means also intermediate progress during loglikelihood computation is shown.}

\item{...}{Any arguments to pass on to plotting functions.}
}
\value{
Each simulated dataset is an element of the list, which can be
called using [[x]]. For example if the object is called island_replicates,
the last replicates is a list in itself. The first (e.g.
island_replicates[[x]][[1]]) element of that list has the following
components: \cr \code{$island_age} - the island age \cr Then, depending on
whether a distinction between types is made, we have:\cr \code{$not_present}
- the number of mainland lineages that are not present on the island \cr
or:\cr \code{$not_present_type1} - the number of mainland lineages of type 1
that are not present on the island \cr \code{$not_present_type2} - the
number of mainland lineages of type 2 that are not present on the island \cr
\code{$stt_all} - STT table for all species on the island (nI - number of
non-endemic species; nA - number of anagenetic species, nC - number of
cladogenetic species, present - number of independent colonisations present
)\cr \code{$stt_stt_type1} - STT table for type 1 species on the island -
only if 2 types of species were simulated (nI - number of non-endemic
species; nA - number of anagenetic species, nC - number of cladogenetic
species, present - number of independent colonisations present )\cr
\code{$stt_stt_type2} - STT table for type 2 species on the island - only if
2 types of species were simulated (nI - number of non-endemic species; nA -
number of anagenetic species, nC - number of cladogenetic species, present -
number of independent colonisations present )\cr \code{$brts_table} - Only
for simulations under 'IW'. Table containing information on order of events
in the data, for use in maximum likelihood optimization.)\cr

The subsequent elements of the list each contain information on a single
colonist lineage on the island and has 4 components:\cr
\code{$branching_times} - island age and stem age of the population/species
in the case of Non-endemic, Non-endemic_MaxAge and Endemic anagenetic
species. For cladogenetic species these should be island age and branching
times of the radiation including the stem age of the radiation.\cr
\code{$stac} - the status of the colonist \cr * Non_endemic_MaxAge: 1 \cr *
ndemic: 2 \cr * Endemic&Non_Endemic: 3 \cr * Non_endemic: 4 \cr
\code{$missing_species} - number of island species that were not sampled for
particular clade (only applicable for endemic clades) \cr \code{$type_1or2}
- whether the colonist belongs to type 1 or type 2 \cr
}
\description{
This function simulates islands with given cladogenesis,
extinction, Kprime, immigration and anagenesis parameters. If a single
parameter set is provided (5 parameters) it simulates islands where all
species have the same macro-evolutionary process. If two paramater sets
(10 parameters) are provided, it simulates islands where two different
macro-evolutionary processes operate, one applying to type 1 species and
other to type 2 species. If two parameter sets and a time shift (11
parameters) are provided, it simulates islands where at the given time
a shift between the parameter sets will occur.

Returns R list object that contains the simulated islands
