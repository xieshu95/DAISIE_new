\usage{
DAISIE_sim_core_constant_rate(time, mainland_n, pars,
  nonoceanic_pars = c(0, 0), hyper_pars = NULL, area_pars = NULL,
  dist_pars = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{Numeric defining the length of the simulation in time units.
For examples, if an island is known to be 4 million years old, setting
time = 4 will simulate the entire life span of the island; setting time = 2
will stop the simulation at the mid-life of the island.}

\item{mainland_n}{A numeric stating the number of mainland species, that
is the number of species that can potentially colonize the island.
If using a clade-specific diversity dependence, this value is set to 1.
If using an island-wide diversity dependence, this value is set to the
number of mainland species.}

\item{pars}{A numeric vector containing the model parameters:
\itemize{
  \item{pars[1]: lambda^c (cladogenesis rate)}
  \item{pars[2]: mu (extinction rate)}
  \item{pars[3]: K (carrying capacity), set K=Inf for diversity
  independence.}
  \item{pars[4]: gamma (immigration rate)}
  \item{pars[5]: lambda^a (anagenesis rate)}
  \item{pars[6]: lambda^c (cladogenesis rate) for either type 2 species
  or rate set 2 in rate shift model}
  \item{pars[7]: mu (extinction rate) for either type 2 species or rate
  set 2 in rate shift model}
  \item{pars[8]: K (carrying capacity) for either type 2 species or rate
  set 2 in rate shift model, set K=Inf for diversity independence.}
  \item{pars[9]: gamma (immigration rate) for either type 2 species or
  rate set 2 in rate shift model}
  \item{pars[10]: lambda^a (anagenesis rate) for either type 2 species
  or rate set 2 in rate shift model}
}
The elements 6:10 are required only when type 2 species are included
or in the rate shift model.}

\item{nonoceanic_pars}{A vector of length two with:
\itemize{
  \item{[1]: the probability of sampling a species from the mainland}
  \item{[2]: the probability of the species sampled from the mainland
  being nonendemic}
  }}

\item{hyper_pars}{A named list of numeric hyperparameters for the rate
calculations as returned by \code{\link{create_hyper_pars}}:
\itemize{
\item{[1]: is d_0 the scaling parameter for exponent for calculating
cladogenesis rate}
\item{[2]: is x the exponent for calculating extinction rate}
\item{[3]: is alpha, the exponent for calculating the immigration rate}
\item{[4]: is beta the exponent for calculating the anagenesis rate.}
}}

\item{area_pars}{A named list containing area and sea level parameters as
created by \code{\link{create_area_pars}}:
\itemize{
  \item{[1]: maximum area}
  \item{[2]: value from 0 to 1 indicating where in the island's history the
  peak area is achieved}
  \item{[3]: sharpness of peak}
  \item{[4]: total island age}
  \item{[5]: amplitude of area fluctuation from sea level}
  \item{[6]: frequency of sine wave of area change from sea level}
  \item{[7]: angle of the slope of the island}
}}

\item{dist_pars}{A named list of a numeric distance from the mainland as
created by \code{\link{create_dist_pars}}:
\itemize{
\item{[1]: is D distance from the mainland}
}}
